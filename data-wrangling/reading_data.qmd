Reading in data from various sources is one of the key skills to get a day of data wrangling started. There are tons of vanilla functions as well as cool packages to do the job.

## Python
```{python}
#| eval: false

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_excel("path.xlsx", sheet_name="Sheet1") # for Excels
df = pd.read_csv("path.csv") # for comma separated
df = pd.read_csv("path.csv", sep=';') # for semicolon separated
```

## R
```{r}
#| eval: false

df <- read_excel("path", sheet = "Sheet1") # readxl package
df <- read.csv("path") # comma separated
df <- read.csv2("path") # semicolon separated

```
