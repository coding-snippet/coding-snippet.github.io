```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
source("setup.R")
```
## The `if` statement
Choices enable you to run different code based on conditions / input.
The most basic form of choices is the `if` statement.

## Python

```{python}
z = 5
if z % 2 == 0:
  print("z is even")
else:
  print("z is uneven")
```

## R
in one line
```{r}
z = 4
if (z %% 2 == 0) print("z is even") else print("z is uneven")
```

in several lines
```{r}
z = 5
if (z %% 2 == 0) {
  print("z is even")
} else {
  print("z is uneven")
}
```

## SQL
Note, that SQLite does not support the "normal" `if` statement. However, the same can be achieved with the `case when` statement.
```{sql}
#| connection: con
-- SQLite flavour
select
  product_id
  , price
  ,  case when price >= 500 then 'high-price' else 'low-price' end as price_categ
from
  products
limit 5;
```
