title: "Filtering dataframes"

```{r}
library(readxl)

# Read the Excel file
customers <- read_excel("data/sample_database.xlsx", sheet = "Customers")
```
Filtering dataframes is a crucial skill of any data scientist and there is probably the most used method in data wrangling.

## Filter by "is equal to" 
The most basic form of filtering is by comparing a search term with the values of a column in a dataframe.

## Python

```{python}
z = 4
if z % 2 == 0:  # True
    print("z is even")
```

## R
in one line
```{r}
z = 4
if (z %% 2 == 0) print("z is even")
print(customers)
```

in several lines
```{r}
z = 5
if (z %% 2 != 0) {
  print("z is not even")
}
```

## SQL

```{sql}
#| eval: FALSE
SELECT
  name
  , age
  , if age > 65 THEN 'oldie, but goldie' else 'adult or underaged' endif as 'Age Group'
from persons;
```
